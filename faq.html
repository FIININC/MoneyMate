If it was up to us you would have the cash in your account right away, but unfortunately we still have to wait on the banks to process the payments so that you get the money in your bank account. Depending on the bank you deal with and the time of day you apply with us, this can take anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hours hours.</p>

<p>We are a legally licensed payday lender in the Province of Ontario and we’ve made our license available on our website for all to see. We are very mindful of our responsibility as an online lender to protect your information, and so we take your privacy very serious. Here is a list of some of the drastic measures we’ve taken to ensure our platform meets the highest security standards:SSL...</p>

                                <div class="details__content">
                            <p>Although we are licensed as an online payday lender in Ontario, we are very much different from your typical payday lender.Most of the payday loan shops only lend you money for a 2 week period and expect you to payback the loan in one lump-sum payment, which then leaves you short on cash again forcing you to take out another payday loan, and this can lead to a debt trap.We on the other hand allow you 2 months to pay back your loan, which gives you more time to recover from your financial struggles, and reduces your cost of borrowing significantly. In addition to that, we help you build a savings buffer so that by the end of the loan term you have some cash savings to carry you on until your next paycheque, so that you are not forced to borrow again.</p>                                </div>

                            <summary class="details__summary">How are you cheaper than payday loans ?</summary>
                            <div class="details__content">
                            <p>This requires a little bit of math to explain but don’t worry its very simple.<br/><br/>Suppose you take an online payday loan for $300. The fee you will pay on that will be $45 ($15 per every $100 of cash advance). Now because you have to pay back the payday loan + fee in 2 weeks, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on that loan will be:<br/><br/>[ fee / loan ] x [ total days in a year / term of the loan ] x 100 = APR<br/>[ $45 / $300 ] x [ 365 days / 14 days ] x 100% = 391%<br/><br/>Using the same variables for a MoneyMate loan, but with a 2 month repayment period instead, we get:<br/><br/>[ $45 / $300 ] x [ 365 days / 60 days ] x 100% = 91%<br/><br/>Thats a difference of 300% !! And all those Savings go back to you! Thats how were different</p>                            </div>
